# The Entangled Dimensions of AI Literacy

This repository contains a visual and conceptual framework for exploring the **Entangled Dimensions of AI Literacy**—not as a fixed set of competencies, but as a dynamic and relational field of inquiry.

The framework identifies **ten interconnected dimensions** that shape how we learn with, through, and about AI systems. These include not only technical aspects like data and algorithms, but also epistemic, ecological, political, and aesthetic considerations. It is designed as a **provocation**—a tool for critical thinking, dialogue, and curricular experimentation.

AI literacy, in this framing, is not a binary (literate/illiterate) but a multidimensional practice that varies across disciplines, contexts, and communities.
